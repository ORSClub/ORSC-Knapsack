# ORSC-Knapsack
This is a webapp created using Streamlit to intuitively introduce the 0/1 Knapsack problem through an example that the user can try to solve and compare with the optimal solution given by the Branch & Bound algorithm.

This project is created as a part of **Operations Research Society Club (ORSC)** activities
